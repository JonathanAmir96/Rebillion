## 2026-07-23 — v3 owner revision + Arc-2 Phase D (session: maps-levels-40-80)

**State now:** design tree is at **v3.1** (five islands, two authored arcs Lv 1–82, cap
300, backtracking law + reserved cross-arc boss-connectivity hook). **Phase D is COMPLETE
for the whole world:** `docs/50_content/` holds every content file — 324 maps, 234
monsters, 234 drop tables + 11 pools, 120 NPCs, 120 quests, 98 skills, all item tables
(T1–T12, uniques 0201–0222, consumables 0001–0020, Emberstone I–V) — and the **strict**
`tools/validate.py` run (no allow-missing, entry map_001, global reachability) passes
with 0 failures, 0 warnings. Remaining known reconciliations: raid_undervault band 15–22
vs Millbrook ceiling 14; `spec_trial_gate` zone token; the Open Questions rollups in the
phase reports. Next phases: art pass (PixelLab briefs), Phase E coding-pass briefs
review, arc-1/arc-2 balance pass.

**v3 decisions (owner + producer):**
- Arc 2 = Frostpeak Isle (40–55) / Arcane Reach (53–68) / Voidshore (66–80); `rift`
  still reserved. Access: the Deepway (Cindershelf `map_125` → `map_201`–`203`,
  `level_gate: 40`) + the paid scheduled `longship` network from Tidewatch Port.
- 2nd job (Lv 40) **branches**: bulwark Ironbrand/Stoneguard/Warcaller · keeneye
  Pathstalker/Sureshot · weaver Runeweaver/Cindercall/Frostbind · flicker
  Duskstep/Wildcard. Skill re-block `skill_<line>_001`–`060` (specs at 007/014/021).
- "Raid" replaced "party quest" everywhere: `raid_undervault`/`raid_mainspring`/
  `raid_deepfrost`(45–55)/`raid_voidtide`(70–80); owner `10_systems/social/RAID.md`;
  party 3–6; solo open-arena fallback kept.
- Items: 12-tier equip ladder (T7–T12 = Lv 43–78, `item_equip_0231`–`0300`), uniques
  0201–0222 (11 bosses), Sovereign/Mythic tonics (`item_use_0017`–`0020`).
- LEVELING: Lv 1–80 rows frozen; provisional linear softcap continuation past 80;
  arc-2 ≈ 90 played hours. Debt cleaned: v1 Rift-raid model (PARTY/SPAWN/DROPS/
  COMBAT_FORMULA/QUESTS) and the retired `waygate` (now `coach`/`longship` everywhere;
  new tokens `coach_station`, `coach_clerk`, `pier_officer` in GLOSSARY Provisional).

**Batch pattern that worked (reuse for arc-1):** producer fixes ID/token decisions →
exemplar-first (one real file per schema, conventions in `50_content/README.md`) →
per-region parallel agents (maps+npcs+quests / mobs+drops+materials) + horizontal
item/skill batches → each batch runs `python3 tools/validate.py --allow-missing` and
fixes its own failures → producer commits per batch, one concern each → final full-tree
gate expecting only cross-arc boundary warnings. Route bosses/formulas to Opus-tier,
map/quest/NPC batches to Sonnet-tier, per `docs/60_agents/roles/ORG.md`.

**Known dangling (closed by the arc-1 batch):** `map_071`/`map_125` reciprocal portals,
`item_use_0011`, `item_etc_0193`–`0197` (enhancement.yaml), arc-1 equip rows 0001–0216,
pools r01–r08, novice/first-job/spec-#1-era skills 001–006. Open Questions live in the
owning docs; rollups in `docs/phase_reports/ARC2_PLAN_REPORT.md` and
`PHASE_D_ARC2_REPORT.md`.
