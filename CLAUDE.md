# CLAUDE.md — Working Rules for This Repository

Rebillion is a **design-documentation tree** for a 2D side-scrolling MMORPG platformer
(Godot 4.3+ target). This run produces docs + machine-loadable YAML content only — no game
code, no generated art. Read `README.md` for the tree map and
`docs/phase_reports/` (+ `memory.md` once it exists) for current generation state.

## Laws (apply to every edit, human or agent)

1. **Tokens are law.** Use only `docs/00_vision/GLOSSARY.md` tokens for stats, resources,
   currency, and shared enums. The banned legacy-genre terms are listed in
   `docs/VALIDATION.md` §1 — that file is the only place they may appear.
2. **Single source of truth.** Rules live in one system doc; entity shapes in one schema;
   content files hold values + references only. Link, never restate.
3. **IDs are immutable** and must sit inside their `docs/ID_REGISTRY.md` block. Extend
   ranges in a new commit if needed; never renumber.
4. **Flag, don't guess.** Unknown token/rule/number → add to the owning doc's
   `## Open Questions` (every doc ends with that section).
5. **Locked files — do not edit:** `docs/40_assets/ART_BIBLE.yaml`,
   `docs/40_assets/UI_ART_SPEC.md`, `docs/30_engineering/ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`
   (owner Agent-3 / master brief). Changes go through their `amendments` /
   Open-Questions channels.
6. **Validate before landing:** the checks in `docs/VALIDATION.md` run on every content
   batch (see `tools/` once the validator lands). US spelling everywhere.

## Current design state

- Five islands, two authored arcs (Lv 1–82; game cap 300, initial design). **Arc 1:**
  Emberfoot Isle (training, maps 001–016) → Harborwind Ferry (paid) → Harthmoor Isle, a
  Victoria-style **ring** (Millbrook south hub ↔ Verdant ↔ Gloomwood ↔ Ashfall ↔ Tidewatch ↔
  Millbrook) around the Clockwork Ruins center, with Sunken Depths as a coastal spur.
  **Arc 2 (Lv 40–80):** the Deepway — a 3-map underground passage from Cindershelf,
  level-gated Lv 40 — surfaces on Frostpeak Isle (40–55); Arcane Reach (53–68) and
  Voidshore (66–80) complete the far isles, linked by the paid, scheduled **longship**
  network from Tidewatch Port (2–3 min real-time sails). Totals: 324 maps, 234 monsters
  (178/45/11), 11 bosses, 4 **raids** (`raid_undervault`/`raid_mainspring`/`raid_deepfrost`/
  `raid_voidtide` — the instanced co-op runs; owner doc `docs/10_systems/social/RAID.md`).
  Town travel is the paid Harthmoor Coachworks (shards) — no free warps. Each job line has a
  home ring town with its instructor (Bulwark→Cindershelf, Keeneye→Tidewatch Port,
  Weaver→Mossmere, Flicker→Millbrook); maps follow the WORLD_PLAN monster-gradient law.
  Terrain is Maple-style footholds + painted terrain chunks (ART_BIBLE amendment AB-001;
  movement rules in MAP_TRAVERSAL.md).
- Jobs: novice → 1st at Lv 8 → 2nd at Lv 40 **branches** into a permanent specialization —
  bulwark: Ironbrand/Stoneguard/Warcaller · keeneye: Pathstalker/Sureshot · weaver:
  Runeweaver/Cindercall/Frostbind · flicker: Duskstep/Wildcard (rosters in
  `docs/10_systems/JOBS.md`); 3rd-tier jobs named-and-reserved for future arcs.
- Pacing (owner ruling 2026-07-24, `docs/10_systems/LEVELING.md`): Lv 40 ≈ 30 h · Lv 80 ≈
  166 h · Lv 100 ≈ 300 h of `/played`; curve `kills_per_level(L) = round(20 + 6.6·L + 0.2·L²)`.
- Social/economy systems are designed but server-deferred; the interim build is solo with a
  server-authoritative boundary (`docs/10_systems/PERSISTENCE.md`).
- Monetization (owner amendment MON-001, 2026-07-23): cosmetic-only + in-world sponsor
  billboards, hard no-pay-to-win charter — `docs/10_systems/MONETIZATION.md`. Direction only;
  no store content is authored this run.

## Git & generation workflow

- `main` is the single source of truth; finished work lands on `main`. Session work lands on
  its designated feature branch, pushed with `git push -u origin <branch>` and merged to
  `main` when done. One concern per commit; content commits separate from doc/rule commits.
- Generation is phased A→E with hard gates (vision → systems → schemas/assets → content →
  coding-pass briefs); each phase emits a report in `docs/phase_reports/`.
- **Phase status (2026-07-24):** A (vision), B (systems), C (schemas/assets gate), D (content —
  all 324 maps / 234 monsters / drops / NPCs / quests / skills / items), plus the post-plan
  waves **F** (integrations), **G** (equipment), **H** (consistency), and **I** (backend design)
  are complete — see their phase reports and `docs/phase_reports/SYNC_AUDIT_v3_2026-07-23.md`.
  The **pacing curve was
  retuned 2026-07-24** (`LEVELING.md`); the authored **quest content's `exp` rewards need a
  mechanical regen** against the new curve (see LEVELING/QUESTS Open Questions). Not yet started:
  **Phase E** (coding-pass briefs), the **art pass** (PixelLab briefs). `memory.md` (newest-first)
  is the authoritative live log.
- PixelLab (art generation, later pass): MCP tools + owner's API token. The token is
  **deliberately not stored in this repo** — ask the owner or use the environment secret
  (suggested var: `PIXELLAB_SECRET`) configured in the Claude Code environment settings.

## For future Claude sessions

Start by reading: `README.md` → `docs/00_vision/GLOSSARY.md` → `docs/WORLD_PLAN.md` →
`memory.md` (state + decisions log, written at the end of the generation run). When
continuing content generation, follow the batch pattern in the phase reports: region-scoped
sub-agents, exemplar-first, validator-gated.

**Doc connectivity (rule):** every markdown doc must be **reachable from `README.md`** by
following links — README's "Start here" section is the tree's index (there is no `docs/` index
file; README is the root). Run `python3 tools/md_graph.py` to rebuild the link graph and
BFS-check it (report: `docs/phase_reports/MD_CONNECTIVITY_REPORT.md`); the tree is currently
one connected component, 98/98 README-reachable. After any wave that adds docs — especially a
parallel-session merge — re-run it and link any new "unreferenced" file from its natural index
(that is exactly how the F/G/H reports and the role files first slipped in undiscoverable).

**Staffing sub-agents:** use the virtual-studio role charter in `docs/60_agents/roles/`
(`ORG.md` = org chart + model routing: easy→Haiku, medium→Sonnet, hard→Opus, route by
blast radius). Invoke as: "Act as ROLE_X per docs/60_agents/roles/ROLE_X.md" — the role
file fixes mission, owned files, reading list, deliverable contract, and tier.
