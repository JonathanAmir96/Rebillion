# SKILL_ANIMATION.md — Skill Animation Clip IDs & Naming

Owner doc for the **per-skill animation clip ID namespace** — the ids
`20_schemas/skill.schema.md`'s `animation` field carries and `docs/VALIDATION.md` §6 checks.
This namespace is distinct from the 12 shared body-state tokens
(`40_assets/ANIMATION_STATES.md`) and never redefines them: a skill's visuals are **fx clips
layered over the shared body states**, synced to `40_assets/ANIMATION_TIMING.md`'s timeline.
Frame/atlas packing for these clips follows `40_assets/SPRITESHEET_SPEC.md` unchanged.

## 1. The anchor id — `skill_<line>_NNN_cast`

Every **active** skill declares exactly one anchor clip id in its `animation` field:

```
skill_<line>_NNN_cast        # e.g. skill_bulwark_003_cast, skill_novice_001_cast
```

- `<line>_NNN` must equal the owning skill's own ID stem (`docs/ID_REGISTRY.md` Skills block;
  `skill_novice_NNN` included). The validator derives the expected anchor from the skill id —
  a mismatched stem fails `docs/VALIDATION.md` §6.
- **Passives declare no anchor** (`20_schemas/skill.schema.md`: `animation` optional/absent for
  passives); a passive may still own a `_proc` fx clip (§2).

## 2. Derived clip suffixes (the multi-clip rule)

A skill needing more than one visual does **not** get a second `animation` field — further clips
derive from the anchor stem by fixed suffix. This resolves `20_schemas/skill.schema.md`'s
multi-clip open question with no schema change:

| Suffix | Clip | When it exists |
|---|---|---|
| `_cast` | The cast fx overlay, played over the body's `cast` (or `attack`) state | Every active — the anchor (§1) |
| `_proj` | Projectile flight loop | Skills whose effect op is `projectile` (`10_systems/SKILL_EFFECTS.md`) |
| `_impact` | On-hit burst at the target/impact point | Optional; any damaging/statusing active |
| `_loop` | Persistent zone / channel loop (ground effects, auras) | Skills with a lingering area or channel |
| `_proc` | Proc flash for a passive's `on_hit_proc` trigger | Passives only, optional |

Rules: suffixes only from this table (new suffixes are proposed here first, GLOSSARY-style —
never invented in content); each clip is its own row set under
`40_assets/SPRITESHEET_SPEC.md`'s manifest; a referenced-but-missing derived clip is an asset-
pass error, not a content-validation error (only the anchor id is validated from the YAML).

## 3. Sync contract (cited, not restated)

- The body plays its shared state (`cast`/`attack`, `40_assets/ANIMATION_STATES.md`); the
  `_cast` fx clip starts on the same frame 0 and the skill's damage lands on the body state's
  `hit_frame` (`40_assets/ANIMATION_TIMING.md` §3 — the load-bearing contract). Fx clips carry
  **no** `hit_frame` of their own.
- `haste` scales fx-clip playback exactly as it scales the body state
  (`40_assets/ANIMATION_TIMING.md` §2/§3.2) so overlays never desync.
- `_proj` flight and `_loop` clips loop untimed; `_impact`/`_proc` are one-shots.

## 4. Monster abilities — explicitly out of this namespace

Monster/boss ability visuals ride the monster's own body states (`cast`, `telegraph`,
`40_assets/ANIMATION_STATES.md`); no `skill_*` clip id may appear on a monster
(`docs/ID_REGISTRY.md` — the player skill ID space is player-only). Whether a future
per-ability fx layer for boss kits is wanted stays `40_assets/SPRITESHEET_SPEC.md`'s open
question, not granted here.

## Open Questions

- Whether `_impact` bursts should be shareable library clips (one generic per element, reused
  across skills) instead of per-skill ids is an art-pass economy call; per-skill ids stay the
  default — a shared library would be proposed here as a reserved `fx_<element>_impact` family
  first.
- Screen-space flourishes (the boss-slam shake, `10_systems/CAMERA.md` OQ) are presentation
  metadata with no home field yet; if a skill-authored hook is wanted it belongs in
  `20_schemas/skill.schema.md` as a new field, flagged there — not smuggled into a clip suffix.
- Exact fx canvas sizes per clip family (vs the entity `size_class` cells,
  `40_assets/SPRITESHEET_SPEC.md` §4) are an art-pass decision; nothing in this doc fixes pixel
  dimensions.
